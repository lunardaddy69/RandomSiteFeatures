Random Code Snippets for my Site I don't Want to Lose

nosecondarynav.css: is for the "Code Injection" page setting in squarespace. Placed in the Header section. This will make sure that the MANY secondary navigation pages don't appear in the Header. Leading to a cleaner looking site.

fontsizechanger.css: is for a small thing I have where there is a paragraph on my page where the text changes size subtly as someone is scrolling the page. This is to be put into the Custom CSS page setting.
